puppeteer is a node lib to work with headless chrome
headless => no UI

you can use headless chrome to do 
end to end testing
smomke test
UI test

AUtomation of some use cases

0:53 ? headless chrome can be a frontend for your webapp frontend

you can put HLC on server and so interesting things

you can launch chrome in headless mode(w/o UI) w/ just --headless commandline flag:
but by itself it is not too useful
we need to combine it w/ something else which is 
--remote-debugging-port=9222
and then we can tap into then dev tools programatically using this port
